# CSE-MATH-180-Student-Performance-Prediction
## Description:
The project aimed to investigate the significant socio-economic factors contributing to affecting student performance in school. We decided to use feature selection to identify important features and predict the students' performance with several machine-learning models.

## Project Details:
- Performed exploratory data analysis techniques like visualizing the descriptive statistics and data distribution through box and bar plots
- Pre-processed the data through one-hot encoding for categorical values and data cleansing
- Utilized subset selection methods and K-fold cross-validation to determine the significant features
- Applied various models such as linear regression, random forest, cubic spline, Multilayer Perceptron
- Tuned the hyperparameters of the Multilayer Perceptron model to enhance prediction ability leading to an 8.5% decrease in test errors
